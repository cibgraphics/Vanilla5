# Vanilla5 v3.0

_Copyright Christopher Bishop 2011-2017._

## What is Vanilla5?

Vanilla5 is a HTML5 based foundation to kickstart the majority of your projects. Perfectly set up to be HTML5 and mobile ready (responsive design). Also uses LESS and SCSS, but you are not forced to use them.

### Features:

* Basic HTML5 template with a header, page contents, and a footer
* Basic CSS, LESS, or SCSS file set up with CSS reset, mixins, variables, includes (where applicable), and responsive stylesheets.
* Print stylesheet included
* Links to the latest jQuery (local and CDN)
* Folders setup for images, includes, and creative
* iOS touch icon and Windows Tile included and setup
* PSD included based on the 960grid.
* Javascript and CSS to fix HTML5 support for IE
* Set up for Google Analytics


You may use this template free of charge with no link backs whatsoever. You may NOT sell this, only give it away to others. If you do give it away, you must credit me by leaving this README with the files unchanged as well as the HTML comments.

# How to use

To use just download the latest copy and extract the files to where your site will be. Thats it.

Everything else depends on your workflow.

#### What is not done
Magic. Seriously, this is a foundation, not a framework. You still have to style your site. I do not assume styles like other (much bloated) frameworks.

# Tips and Tricks

There are a lot of things that Vanilla5 does for you automatically, a lot you have to do yourself. Here are a couple helpers that I have included.

## Using Grunt

Grunt is a Javascript task runner build upon Node.js. This is super helpful for doing things like processing LESS/SCSS, minifying, image optimization, ect. If you are unfamiliar with how to use Grunt visit http://gruntjs.com/getting-started.

The files included are the basics. You still need to know how to install the Grunt CLI and Grunt plugins.

## Clearing a Float

Included in Vanilla5 is a progressive way to clear floats. All it uses is a single class name of clear-fix on the element or container that is floated.


```html
<div class="clear-fix">
  <div class="left"></div>
  <div class="right"></div>
</div>
```

## LESS or SCSS Variables

Vanilla5 is already set up with some cool variables. You can find these in the css -> less -> includes -> variables.less or css -> scss -> includes -> variables.scss

Make sure you edit these instead of taking out their references. They can be really useful.

## Automatic REM conversion using LESS or SCSS

You can change px into rems automatically using included LESS or SCSS mixins.

__ALERT: You have to have the font-size variable set in order for this to work!!__ You can find it in your variables file.

### Syntax:

**For SCSS:**

```css
@include rem-size($value, $property);
```
**For LESS:**

```css
rem-size(@value, @property);
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Argument</th>
    <th>Required</th>
    <th>Default</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value</td><td>Required</td><td>None</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Property</td><td>Optional</td><td>'font-size'</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Usage

**For SCSS:**

```css
p {
  @include rem-size(20px);
}
```
**For LESS:**

```css
p {
  .rem-size(20px);
}
```
Compiles to:
```css
p {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-size: 2rem; // this value depends on what you have set as your font-size base
}
```

### Controlling Property

By default this mixin will output to font-size. If you need to use another property instead of font-size you can pass a 2nd argument with the desired property to the mixin.

## Google Analytics

Included in Vanilla5 is the code for Google Analytics. Visit their webpage and create a tracking code.

Inserting them into Vanilla5 is super easy. Open the google-analytics.js file located in js -> lib folder.

All you need to do is edit the two javascript variables with your information.

```javascript
var trackingID = '',
    URL        = '';
```
